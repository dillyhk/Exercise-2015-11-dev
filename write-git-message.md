# Write Git Message

## What it does

- You are required to write some Git commit message when running "git commit" or "git merge".
- You should follow some conventions to write a good and proper git message.
- The purpose is to let others know what you did in your commit.
- Use concise, clear language. Try to make your message still readable after, say, 5 years.

## Examples

- Add instant messaging function.
- Modify report A from Enlish version to Chinese version.
- Delete user abc.

## Notes

- Do not use past tense ("did what"), instead, use current tense ("do what").
