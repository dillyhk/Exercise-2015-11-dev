# Git installation

## What it does

Git installation is not a command, but the process of the installation of git.
Git can be installed on Windows, Linux, Mac, and Unix.
On Linux you can use the "yum" or "apt-get" commands.
On Windows and Mac, you can download it from Git official website (see "Reference Links" below).

## Examples

- Linux command: sudo yum install git-all  #

## Notes

Git itself is free.
But websites (such as github) usually require a license fee.
